# tetrio-chat
A tool that allows you to chat in any room on the game TETR.IO without going to the website

## Required modules
* python-socketio
* pillow
* requests
* websocket-client (Very important if you do not want to be disconnected after 25 seconds!)

## How to run
First, place the "resources" folder in the same directory as the script. Then, simply paste your TETR.IO token into a file called "token.txt" and run!

**Note**: If you frequently keep getting disconnected, make sure that the "websocket-client" module is installed.

**Attention:** Upon joining a room, you will be placed into spectator mode. **THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT--AND WILL NEVER--SUPPORT ACTUAL GAMEPLAY. TETR.IO has server-side anti-cheat. You have been warned.**

Thank you to OSK for creating such an amazing game!
